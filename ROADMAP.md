# Feature Roadmap

A list of features that I find interesting to play around with.
The [Backlog](#Backlog) contains an unsorted list of random ideas.
Inside [Versions](#Versions) you'll find more "changelog"-style features, either implemented or WIP.


## Backlog
 - Spend Mana for Attacks / Skills
 - UI
   * Damage Numbers
   * Healthbar
   * Main Menu
   * Mana spending, Ability Picker
 - Controls / Abilities
   * Move with stick is boring. Better keep moving and change direction with swipe?
   * Double swipe to dash. Requires charge? Does damage etc based on skills.
 - Basic Attacks
   * Sword Rain. Shoots swords from the sky, one by one, sticking them into the ground.
   * 
 - Special Attacks
   * Backstab (Triggers when switching direction by ~180Â°)
 - Synergies
   * Buildable Attacks? (think Noita wands)
   * Chainable Attacks? (Shoot bullet, Sword Swing attack attached to bullet will swing around it)
   * Elements? (think Genshin Impact)
 - Juice!
   * Walk Animation
   * Screen Shake
     - Zoom out a bit on mana collect? Adds together
   * On Enemy Hit
     - White Flash
	 - Bounce back
   * Animate Healthbar Loss
 - Enemies
   * Walk towards player
   * Fly in a fixed direction near player (maybe with swarm-like flocking?)
   * Stand in a fixed position, ranged attacks
   * Bosses
     - Minions swarming around them
	 - Special attack patterns
	 - Not just stronger enemies that follow you.
 - Levels
   * Infinite Mode with waves, Shop / Camp spawns in between waves.
   * "Story"-Mode, premade/generated Maps with Enemies
   * In both(?) modes: Challenge NPC (think Enter the Gungeon).
     - High Damage but Single Hit
	 - ...
 - Performance
   * Spatial Partitioning (Grid / Quadtree) System
