## Rendering Backend

I want to decide & settle on a rendering backend for this & future projects.
Generally, I want pretty good performance, a non-intrusive and clean API as well as cross platform support.
SDL2 is a great choice that will definitely stay (as an alternative GLFW feels a bit better to use, but the platform support of SDL2 is unmatched).

 1. [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) is pretty nice, but documentation/resources are not that much to my liking.
 Additionally, its shading language & tool `shaderc` does feel somewhat awkward to use and documentation is rather sparse.
 Still, platform support & performance is great.

 2. [sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol) seems to be a bit nicer, but I haven't really looked into it.
 Resources seems to be a bit better than bgfx, however the stb-style library seems to be a bit too awkward for projects of this size.

 3. Another choice would be to write my own rendering abstraction layer, and use OpenGL 3/4 for Linux/Windows and OpenGL ES for Emscripten/Android.
 This seems really interesting and fun, but would potentially interfere more with my goal of actually writing a game rather than an engine.
 On the other hand, I feel really at home with OpenGL which could make development faster. OpenGL ES is similar enough to Core so it shouldn't be too much of a hassle to write 2 shaders for everything once the backends are implemented.
 Implementing Vulkan/DirectX/Metal backends could at some point be a great learning exercise.


As I am currently pretty much just rendering sprites I will continue working with bgfx until I have more motivation to compare alternatives.
